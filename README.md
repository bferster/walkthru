WALK |THRU is an adaptive web-based tool to help instructors create procedural learning sessions that take advantage of the start of the art web technologies that allow for a richer range of scaffolding a learner through a given process beyond simple text and images. These include audio narration, video, screencasts, simple animations, and live control of web applications.The learner can interact with the process by trying each step out themselves, getting feedback and hints along the way to scaffold learning.

The instructor writes a lesson as a series of steps, which are stored in their Google Docs account. These steps provide the heartbeat to the instruction to which all the elements keep in time to: narration, steps of a worked example, hints, examples, images, animations, etc. The learner controls the progress with a timeline and can effortlessly move through the steps in the lesson. 
 
Opportunities can be provided for the learner to stop and try out things for themselves and receive feedback from those efforts. These are context dependent. A math lesson might offer a portion of problem to solve, coding might ask to code a small portion. Alternatively,a number of assessments could help cement understanding.
 
The actual learning path is independent from the presentation of the content. WALK |THRU maintains an internal model of the learner’s ability and this map can help guide what content is presented to match learners needs and save time. DIYs and traditional assessments, like quizzes and exercises, provide data for the adaptive portion of WALK |THRU to provide formative assessment, additional help, and alteration of the learning path.
 
The actual mechanism to set the path is extensible and can use a wide range of inference methods from top-down rules, such as used in expert systems, Bayesian belief networks,  Markov models, and machine learning (AI) based techniques provide there is enough data to train on.
